    From now until the end of the experiment, please stay focused on the task at hand, 
    as your payment highly depends on your performance in the experiment. 
    If you have any questions, please send the host a private message; the experimenter will answer your question. 
    Please pay careful attention to the instructions as real money is at stake.

    During the experiment, you will play 15 rounds and earn points in each round. 
    Your total payoff in this experiment is the sum of payoffs you earn in each round. 
    At the end of the experiment, your points will be converted to US dollars as your payment at the rate of 60 points = $1. 
    You are guaranteed a show-up fee of $4.00 but can earn considerably more.
