        You are <b>{{ role }}</b> in this round.

    <p>
        There are two types of the product, X and Y, and they have different values to consumers. 
        The value is <b>{{ utility_l }} points</b> for a <b>type X</b> product, 
        and <b>{{ utility_h }} points</b> for a <b>type Y</b> product.
    </p> 
    <p>
        Consumers will choose the product with the highest net benefits (<b>value - price</b>). 
    </p>
    <p>
        {{ if treat == 'CC' }}
            Consumers will NOT know your product type in stage 2, 
            so they will believe your product is either type with equal probabilities. 
            That is the expected value of your product will be {{ utility_m }} points. 
            Your exact product type will be revealed in stage 3 
            if there are consumers buying from you in stage 2. 
        {{ elif treat == 'FC' }}
            There will be {{ search }} consumers who are able to buy the product only from you in stage 2. 
            Consumers will NOT know your product type in stage 2, 
            so they will believe your product is either type with equal probabilities.
            That is the expected value of your product will be {{ utility_m }} points. 
            Your exact product type will be revealed to the entire 100 consumers in stage 3 
            if there are consumers buying from you in stage 2.

        Your counterpart chose {{ opponent_quality }} at this stage.

    <p>
        Your production cost is <b>{{ cost }} points</b> for <b>type X</b> but <b>{{ cost_e }} points</b> for <b>type Y</b>. 
    </p>
    <p> 
        Your payoff is calculated as <math><b>(price - cost) &times; demand</b></math>, where <math><b> demand </b></math> is the number of consumers 
        who buy your product in each stage.
